# Dataset

# Project Idea
In this project, we will focus on clustering and apply unsupervised learning techniques to find the best candidate algorithm that accurately predicts wether a company has net profit or net loss. To do that, we will transform Net Income column into a binary representation of whether or not a company made profit, where 0 represents loss and 1 represents profit.

Why do we use net income?

Net income indicates a company's profit after all of its expenses have been deducted from revenues. This number appears on a company's income statement and is also an indicator of a company's profitability
